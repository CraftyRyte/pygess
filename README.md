The provided Python module files consist of several interconnected classes and functions, mainly focused on creating and managing game objects in a Pygame environment. Below is the detailed documentation and guide for each file, with explanations of all functions and classes. I have divided the guide by module to make it easier to understand each part of your PyGess library.

# PyGess (Pygame Essentials) Documentation

## **Module 1: physics.py**

### Overview
This module handles the physics of game objects and worlds. It defines classes for managing game entities, updating the state of worlds, and handling collision detection, gravity, and delta time updates.

### **Classes**

#### `GameObjects`
- **Purpose**: A container for managing and updating multiple game entities.
  
- **Constructor**: 
  ```python
  def __init__(self, entities: list) -> None:
  ```
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `entities (list)`: List of game objects (entities).
  - **Returns**: None.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `update(self)`: Updates all entities in the list.
  - `append(self, *entity)`: Adds new entities to the current list of game objects.

#### `World`
- **Purpose**: Represents a world with gravity, which can contain multiple game objects and handle updates, such as delta time and object states.
  
- **Constructor**:
  ```python
  def __init__(self, grav: tuple, *game_objects) -> None:
  ```
  - **Parameters**:
    - `grav (tuple)`: The gravity vector for the world.
    - `game_objects`: Game objects to initialize in the world.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `update(self)`: Updates the world's state, including game objects and gravity.
  - `add_gameobj(self, *gameobj)`: Adds new game objects to the world.
  - `load_new_object(self, *gameobj)`: Loads new objects into the runtime state of the world.
  - `update_delta_time(self)`: Updates the delta time for smoother animations and movements.
  - `__reset(self)`: Resets the world to its initial state.
  - `__set_runtime(self)`: Sets the runtime state.
  - `set_world_active(self, active: bool)`: Sets the activity status of the world (start/stop).
  
#### `get_active_world()`
- **Purpose**: Returns the currently active world.

## **Module 2: entity.py**

### Overview
This module defines various types of game entities, including their movement, collision detection, and interaction with the world.

### **Classes**

#### `Entity`
- **Purpose**: A base class representing a game entity.
  
- **Constructor**:
  ```python
  def __init__(self, position: tuple, dimensions: tuple, color: tuple = None, image_path: str = None) -> None:
  ```
  - **Parameters**:
    - `position (tuple)`: Position of the entity.
    - `dimensions (tuple)`: Size of the entity.
    - `color (tuple, optional)`: Color of the entity.
    - `image_path (str, optional)`: Path to the image file representing the entity.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `update_rect(self)`: Updates the entity's position rectangle.
  - `check_collisions(self)`: Checks for collisions with other entities.
  - `is_colliding_with(self, rect)`: Returns whether the entity is colliding with a specific rectangle.
  - `get_all_obj_colliding_with(self)`: Returns all objects the entity is colliding with.
  - `update(self)`: Updates the entity's state in the world.

#### `MovingEntity(Entity)`
- **Purpose**: Inherits from `Entity`, with additional movement and velocity properties.
  
- **Constructor**:
  ```python
  def __init__(self, position: tuple, dimensions: tuple, velocity: tuple, color: tuple = None, image_path: str = None) -> None:
  ```
  - **Parameters**: Same as `Entity` with the addition of:
    - `velocity (tuple)`: Initial velocity of the entity.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `update(self)`: Updates the entity, including its movement.
  - `move(self)`: Moves the entity based on its velocity and delta time.
  - `set_gravitified(self, bool: bool)`: Sets whether the entity is affected by gravity.
  - `set_velocity(self, velocity)`: Sets the entity's velocity.

## **Module 3: data.py**

### Overview
This module handles storing data related to game objects, such as position and collision data.

### **Variables**
- `all_rects`: A list that stores all the rectangles in the game world for collision detection.

---

## **Module 4: colors.py**

### Overview
This module contains predefined color values in RGB format for ease of use in the game development process.

### **Color Variables**
- `BLACK`: `(0, 0, 0)`
- `WHITE`: `(255, 255, 255)`
- `RED`: `(255, 0, 0)`
- `GREEN`: `(0, 255, 0)`
- `BLUE`: `(0, 0, 255)`
- `YELLOW`: `(255, 255, 0)`
- `CYAN`: `(0, 255, 255)`
- `MAGENTA`: `(255, 0, 255)`

## **Usage Guide**

### Setting Up a World
1. Create a world with gravity:
   ```python
   world = World((0, 9.81))
   ```

2. Add game objects to the world:
   ```python
   player = MovingEntity((100, 100), (50, 50), (0, 0), color=colors.RED)
   world.add_gameobj(player)
   ```

3. Activate and update the world:
   ```python
   world.set_world_active(True)
   while True:
       world.update()
   ```

### Creating a New Game Object
1. Create a static entity:
   ```python
   box = Entity((200, 300), (100, 100), color=colors.BLUE)
   ```

2. Create a moving entity affected by gravity:
   ```python
   ball = MovingEntity((150, 200), (50, 50), (0, 10), color=colors.GREEN)
   ball.set_gravitified(True)
   ```
